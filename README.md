## Guessing Game
> You are to write a program to play the following game:

>I am going to generate 9 numbers between 0 and 1 independently and uniformly at random. Then I am going to give you the numbers one at a time, and after each one, you have to guess its position among the 9 numbers.

> For example, I might give you 0.2, and you might guess that 0.2 is the smallest number of the 9. Then I might give you 0.99, and you might guess that it is the biggest of the 9. Then I might give you 0.1, and now you lose, because you guessed that 0.2 was the smallest and it wasn't.

> Obviously, you won't win all of the time. Your goal is to write a program that wins as often as possible. Your program will play 1,000,000 games, and its score is the number of games it wins.

I've written the wrapper + a sample entrant here (if you don't mind CoffeeScript).  My best entry after about an hour of coding is ~0.82% win rate.  Can you do better?
